# A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. 
Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. 
Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.

The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016.
